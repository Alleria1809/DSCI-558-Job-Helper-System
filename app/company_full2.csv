The city has emerged as a banking center and is the world headquarters for 13 Fortune 500 companies.

They believed in peace. They made monumental sacrifices for that peace.  And because of them Atlanta became a fast-pace modern city which opened its doors to the 1996 Olympics.

Die-hard Southerners view Atlanta as the heart of the Old Confederacy; Atlanta has become the best example of the New South, a fast-paced modern city proud of its heritage.

The FNIH is not only involved in large, ambitious initiatives with potentially high impact on the lives of millions of the world’s citizens, but it also supports smaller focused programs in clinical training and ancillary support programs.

The FNIH helps to underwrite biomedical initiatives that might not be attractive for private funding alone, or for one reason or another are not appropriate for wholly public funding. The FNIH may take on projects that are particularly risky in terms of the likelihood of success or where companies may be willing to forgo profits because of early stage nature of the program or in the case of some global health initiatives due to the charitable nature of the project. 

The FNIH's projects tend to be longer-term, operating on a time scale that can be unattractive for private investors. At the same time the foundation is capable of responding quickly and nimbly to funding needs that are immediate and pressing.

With the goals of NIH as its guide, the FNIH serves both the public and private sectors, helping them achieve significant breakthroughs in human health in areas of interest that overlap with those of NIH.

After experiencing firsthand the perils of choosing the wrong lawyer and representation after his brother Tim was paralyzed, he dedicated his life to helping people so that no one should ever have to go through what his family endured.

Tim was just a teenager when he was working as a lifeguard at Disney World when he suffered a spinal injury that left him confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life. The Morgans made a life altering decision and they hired the wrong lawyer, who was by no means qualified to take on such a large corporation and their army of lawyers. As a result, Tim never got the compensation he deserved. 

This experience left John outraged and determined to level the playing field for all people who, like his brother Tim, were injured or mistreated by big and powerful corporations. John decided to become a lawyer, and the rest is history. 

Since 1988, Morgan & Morgan has been fighting for the people. Every client who walks through our doors is treated the same way John wished his family would have been treated all those years ago. No one, no matter who they are, or where they’re from, should ever feel powerless when fighting for the justice and compensation they deserve.

Central Ohio Primary Care was founded in 1996 when a group of 33 physicians joined together to give greater focus to patient care than the administrative duties that were weighing them down. From the onset, COPC physicians have always been dedicated to finding new ways to offer the best patient care.

Today we have more than 70 practices and serve more than 400,000 patients. However, what’s most notable isn’t our size, but that we have grown beyond the primary care office. We have a hospitalist team with physicians at hospitals across the region, we’re opening more SameDay Centers, and are expanding our ancillary services.

We are leading the nation with a system that supports the entire care of each COPC patient.

A model we believe is THE BEST FOR PRIMARY CARE.

The Junior Museum of Miami, a private non-profit organization, was established in 1950 in a house on the corner of Biscayne Boulevard and 26th Street. The Junior Museum expanded so quickly that in 1952 it was forced to move to the Miami Women's Club building on Bayshore Drive. It was then christened the Museum of Science and Natural History.

The institution, however, again began outgrowing its new space. By 1960, the first building of the community's new science museum opened its doors. The facility, located on three acres of the historic Vizcaya complex, was built and furnished rent-free by the County.

Late 1966 saw the construction of a Space Transit Planetarium which soon became the leading facility of its kind in the world. Its activities now include international television programming.

In 1989, the Museum's lease agreement with the County for the Vizcaya site was extended for 99 years.

During the last decade, the Museum has expanded to provide space for 4,000 member families, over 250,000 annual visitors, one of the largest summer science camps in the nation (ages 3 to 14) and countless additional exhibits, collections and activities. The yearly operating budget has grown to 2.5 million dollars.

Present science education needs in South Florida again require expansion of these facilities. Though the history of the institution can be charted by the growth of its facility, this story is ultimately one of people. For almost 50 years, the Miami Science Museum and Space Transit Planetarium has been nurtured by a legion of tireless volunteers and generous contributors. Their abundance of vision and dedication has rarely been equaled by any other civic group in the city's history.

With his world-renowned team of scientists & product developers, the KISS founder’s passion is to invent DIY beauty products that save women a tremendous amount of time, effort and money.

Empowering women to “bring the salon home” and express their personal style, on their terms, is the KISS WAY since day one, and it has thrived beautifully over the past 30 years.

Among many notable KISS accomplishments, the first DIY glue on artificial nail was met with rave reviews, but by far, the company’s shining star is the press-on nail. Featuring patented SuperHold technology and an amazing gel finish, this innovation literally revolutionized the beauty industry, giving women the ability to complete a much sought after gel mani, in minutes, with reliably long-lasting results.

KISS is also a major player in the false eyelash business. In fact, new technology and styling methods and trend-setting designs have made KISS a market leader in lashes, with a huge customer and celebrity fan base.

605,VISCO Global Trade Software,Kingston,NY,"Kingston, NY",11-50 employees,http://www.viscosoftware.com/,Software Development,"VISCO was designed specifically for importers and distributors, with an emphasis on chemical, plastics, food, and wine. Origins of the system and its founders date all the way back the 1980s, but VISCO's first customer went live in 2004. Since then we have evolved with the market to provide robust Warehouse Management, Inventory Management, Procurement, and more.

The software can thrive on its own as a CRM and Supply Chain solution giving your team all the tools an import and distribution business needs to operate efficiently. It can also integrate seamlessly with existing accounting systems like QuickBooks, Xero, the Sage/MAS Suite or most any Microsoft platform (Great Plains, etc.) to deliver a full and complete ERP solution for significantly less time, effort and money than a massive ERP implementation typically requires. VISCO was designed and developed with an emphasis on costing, lot tracking, importing compliance, as well as a fully-functional CRM module. With VISCO, all departments can communicate effectively, providing a platform for cohesive teamwork. The document management module pulls data directly from the database, and uses Microsoft Office integration to develop all necessary documents for import and export.

When issues arise during the distribution process, VISCO will assess the issue and email notifications to the correct team member, so that management can work quickly to find a solution. For example, if any POs have not shipped that were scheduled to do so, shipping managers are notified so that they can coordinate an updated ship date with the vendor. Several notifications come pre-built into the software, but customized alerts can be easily created. We can customize further using integration touch-points including our own API and custom report tools.

For distributors and importers seeking an end-to-end distribution, ERP, and procurement system to help streamline workflow and boost productivity, we recommend VISCO as an option to explore.

Sowing operations: once a customer's seed is received to a PlantTape sowing facility, it is inventoried and stored in a secure, climate-controlled room until sowing.

Seeds are sown into PlantTape material, after which the material is cut into strips (i.e, ""tape""), folded, and loaded into trays of 840 seeds each.

The sown PlantTape is palletized, wrapped and labeled for immediate delivery to a commercial nursery or farming operation  for germination at the desired time.

Because PlantTape sows seeds into a completely dry tape environment, growers can delay germination to account for unforeseen changes in weather or transplanting schedule.

Nursery operations: nurseries initiate germination via standard irrigation methods.

PlantTape trays hold 840 plants—2-3 times more than standard transplant trays. With a denser seedling population, PlantTape maximizes nursery space and improves efficiencies through the nursery and field transportation process.

PlantTape transplants can be planted at any stage of growth. Such flexibility in the planting schedule allows growers to mitigate the impact of adverse weather and other uncontrollable circumstances.

Because PlantTape seedlings can be planted much younger than conventional transplants, nurseries have shorter growing cycles and higher overall throughput.

Transplanting: from the nursery, trays of PlantTape transplants are loaded into bins and shipped to the field, where they are loaded into the PlantTape automated transplanter.
The transplanter pulls the PlantTape material from the trays and places each transplant into the ground according to precise settings line spacing, plant spacing, and depth.

AOI is a leading designer and manufacturer of fiber optic networking products. We primarily serve three growing end-markets: cable television broadband, fiber-to-the-home, and internet data centers. We are vertically integrated with a product portfolio from laser chips, components, sub-assemblies and modules, to complete turn-key equipment. 

All three of our end-markets are driven by bandwidth demand fueled by the growth of network connected devices, such as video traffic, cloud computing and online social networking. To address this increased demand, CATV and telecommunications service providers are investing to improve their networks in competition to deliver  voice, video, and data services to their subscribers. Rising bandwidth consumption is also driving demand for higher speed server connections in the internet data center market. As a result of these trends, fiber optic networking technology has become fundamental in all three of our target markets to meet these needs.

Our vertical integration, broad product lines, and in-house design capability uniquely position AOI to serve these markets and offer us the flexibility to address tomorrow's fiber optic applications.

We are committed to providing pure, powerful products for every family and lifestyle, all infused with the life-changing benefits of our essential oils.
Our community of wellness started small in 1993, when D. Gary Young and Mary Young developed their first organic herb farming and distillation operation. At the time, Gary Young had already discovered the incredible power of essential oils, but because the quality of available oils varied so greatly, he’d been unable to fully harness their potential. Mary’s previous experience in the direct-selling industry enabled the Young's to fulfill their vision and establish a business that would empower its members to share truly pure essential oils with the world.

After establishing Young Living in 1994, the Young's developed more farmland in Utah and Idaho and began cultivating lavender, peppermint, melissa, clary sage, and many other herbs. Fueled by a growing demand for top-quality essential oils, Young Living designed and built the largest, most technologically advanced essential oil distillery in North America. In harmony with these efforts, Young Living developed its groundbreaking Seed to Seal® process, which preserves the integrity and potency of essential oils through every step of the production process.

Headquartered in Lehi, Utah, with offices in Australia, Europe, Canada, Japan, and Singapore, as well as farms around the world, Young Living stays true to the Young's original vision.

When we say we ""enrich the lives in the communities we serve,"" we take it to heart because we live it every day. At COUNTRY Financial, there are countless moments that prove it.  

It's the claims rep who leaves her family for weeks, then drives through the night to help clients rebuild after a hurricane.

It's the widower who can keep the house and put the kids through college because 10 years ago, his financial rep started the right conversation.

It's the agency assistant who spends weekends sewing masks for essential workers during a pandemic.

It's the ITS team, who in a moment's notice, helps an entire corporation transition to remote work so we can continue to keep the promise we made to our clients.

It's a company that, despite a turbulent market, triples the grant budget so our reps can provide even more support to first responders and healthcare workers when they need it most.

We believe our clients and communities are at the heart of everything we do. It's represented in how we act. It's how we serve. It's how we treat our clients and each other.

We’ve grown to meet this challenge, investing in technology, global resources and a network of the world’s most integrated glassmaking facilities and processes.

But the greatest investment is the one made by our people – generations of highly trained glassmakers who take pride in crafting everything we imagine, touch, test and deliver.

The origins of Carlex can be traced back to 1936 when Central Glass Co. Ltd., then known as Ube Soda Industry Co. Ltd., was established in Japan. In 1958, the company launched it's glass business, followed by the acquisition of a North American architectural glass facility in Seattle, WA in 1974, and then opening its first major automotive glass facility in Vonore, TN in 1991 in partnership with Ford Motor Company.

Carlex has continually focused on one thing: a commitment to excellence in providing the best automotive glass products to its global customers. This has been a springboard as Carlex grew from the single Vonore facility in 1995, to the 2011 purchase of Ford’s former Nashville, TN float glass, fabrication operations, and the aftermarket business which doubled its North American footprint. Carlex  doubled its size in 2014 by acquiring three manufacturing sites in Auburn and Ligonier, IN and Grevenmacher, Luxembourg.

GAL's 100,000 sq. ft. manufacturing facility is located in the Bronx, near Yankee Stadium, at 50 East 153rd St.

In 2005 GAL acquired Elevator Components Inc. (ECI), merging them with GAL Canada.

We treat each client with the respect they deserve, with the understanding that there is no shortage of contracting firms out there vying for their attention.

2585,Memorial Hermann Health System,Houston,TX,"Houston, TX",10000+ Employees,https://www.memorialhermann.org/,Health Care Services & Hospitals,"At Memorial Hermann Health System, our 29,000 employees and 6,200 affiliated physicians share a vision to create healthier communities, now and for generations to come. As part of our commitment to realizing this vision, we have advanced our efforts around equity, diversity and inclusion; expanded our work in the community and refocused on reducing our system’s impact on the environment. What follows is a brief summary of our current efforts in those areas.

Equity, Diversity and Inclusion in the Workplace and Beyond
At Memorial Hermann, we’re committed to building a culture of inclusion. Through our Equity, Diversity & Inclusion (EDI) initiatives, we have taken a “total system” approach, requiring the pulling of both behavioral and structural levers. In March 2022, Memorial Hermann appointed Dr. Toi Harris as Chief Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Officer to build on Memorial Hermann’s existing EDI initiatives by identifying and championing future opportunities to ensure that EDI will be the driving force behind every decision made and every action taken at Memorial Hermann. In addition, Memorial Hermann has established an EDI Executive Council that is sponsored by Memorial Hermann President and Chief Executive Officer David Callender, MD, and chaired by Memorial Hermann Chief Administrative and Legal Officer Deborah Gordon. The EDI Executive Council provides advocacy and oversight for Memorial Hermann’s EDI initiatives and programs while establishing the EDI roadmap for the entire system.

Improving the Health of the Community
To advance our vision of creating healthier communities, we first must recognize that the health of our community cannot change by focusing on health care alone. There are social and economic factors that can pose barriers to health. That’s why we are expanding our focus beyond hospital and clinic walls to address the social determinants of health by aligning our efforts around four key pillars:

- Access to Care
- Emotional Well-being
- Food as Health
- Exercise is Medicine

Memorial Hermann Community Benefit Corporation
Every three years, Memorial Hermann Community Benefit Corporation conducts a Community Health Needs Assessment to collect data and analysis for Harris, Fort Bend, Montgomery and Brazoria counties, which comprise the majority of Memorial Hermann discharges. Based on these studies, Memorial Hermann works with other healthcare providers, government agencies, business leaders and community stakeholders to ensure area residents have access to the services they need to improve their quality of life and the overall health of the community. Through Memorial Hermann Community Benefit Corporation, we are employing a collective set of strategies to develop efforts targeted at improving the health of the underinsured and uninsured in our community, such as:

- Community Resource Centers
- Neighborhood Health Centers
- Inpatient and ER Navigation
- School-based Health Centers
- 24-hour Nurse Triage Line
- Pharmacy Services and Education
- Psychiatric Social Worker
- Direct Primary Care Partnership
- Intensive Outpatient Case Management for Complex Patients
- Free Primary Care for Eligible Patients
- Multi-visit Patient Efforts & Education Strategies

Anchoring Investment in the Community
Hospitals have a long tradition of serving as Anchor Institutions within their communities, providing not only health care, but contracting with local businesses to purchase goods and services for building facilities and strengthening local businesses. Memorial Hermann proudly serves as a member of the Healthcare Anchor Network. As an Anchor Institute, we are working to leverage and align our resources to create meaningful change in Houston neighborhoods. We recognize that our investments don’t always have to be of a clinical nature to improve the health of the neighborhoods we serve.

Protecting and Improving the Environment
We only have one planet. The health and well-being of life on earth is intertwined with societal and ecological systems on which we all depend. To help ensure that people can live healthier lives, all organizations must reexamine how they operate on a day-to-day basis. In the healthcare industry, we not only must take care of our patients and the health of our community, but we must take care of the environment as well.

Building and Operating Sustainable Facilities
Sustainability is a guiding principle for our teams involved in the planning, design, construction and operations of our facilities. From cooling and lighting systems designed to reduce energy use to optimizing for natural building materials whenever possible to standardizing facilities for maximum efficiency in operation and maintenance, we strive to utilize the latest technical and industry expertise to further our goals in building and operating environmentally friendly facilities.

Our approach to projects emphasizes safety, operability, and maintainability while not losing sight of our client's need to manage project cost. To do so, Cannon fosters a collegial environment where education and training are at the forefront through professional development programs which includes leadership training, technical training, mentoring and more. 

Through our Cannon Relief Crew (CRC) and Loose Cannons Teams, we find the important balance between working hard and playing even harder. It is about doing things together, as a team, that we might not try on our own. Year after year we go beyond where we thought we could, stretching our minds and bodies (and hamstrings) with extreme challenges. Just ask yourself: Do you want to just have a job or do you want to accomplish great feats, bigger than anything you could have imagined doing on your own? That’s what Loose Cannons is all about.

The company was founded in 1960 when founder Bruce T. Halle rented a building on Stadium Boulevard in Ann Arbor, MI. Although the inventory consisted of only six tires (four of which were retreads) and the showroom was not quite the showroom we see today, faith, vision and hard work were then, and still remain, the foundation on which this company has grown and prospered.

As with any new start up, Bruce Halle's venture faced numerous challenges - perhaps one of the biggest being that he didn't own an air compressor. Having only six tires and a portable air tank, Halle would race back and forth to a nearby gas station, filling the tires with air as he sold them. Day by day, tire by tire, this one-man operation slowly grew into what is now one of the most recognized names in the industry.

Discount Tire has a vision that not only lives but thrives in the hearts of its employees each and every day. From part-time to full-time employees at the store, regional or corporate level our employees work to be the best in the business.

One common thread running through the hearts of everyone within the organization remains the same - treat customers and fellow employees with respect and fairness. Care for those in need, always do what is right, work hard, be responsible and have fun.

The employees of Discount Tire represent our philosophy and its brand by remaining knowledgeable, friendly and honest. By offering the highest level of customer service, more product choices and the lowest prices, they have earned the right to be considered trusted experts. 

Building customer relationships has allowed Discount Tire to become a leader in the industry.

DICK’S Sporting Goods was founded in 1948 when an 18-year-old Dick Stack was working at an Army surplus store in Binghamton, New York. An avid fisherman, Dick was approached by the store owner to come up with a list of products needed to get into the fishing tackle business. After Dick presented his suggestions, the owner told him he was a dumb kid and had no idea what he was doing. Dick was upset and promptly quit. He went to his grandmother’s house where he spent a lot of time as a kid and told her what had happened. Dick’s grandmother asked how much it would cost to build the store himself. Dick said it would cost $300. His grandmother then went to the cookie jar where she kept her life savings and gave him $300 and told him, “Do it yourself.” Dick used that money and his relentless work-ethic to open a bait-and-tackle shop in Binghamton. By the late 1970's, he expanded his product line to include much of what you’ll find at DICK’S Sporting Goods today.

AND LIVES ON...
Today, headquartered in Pittsburgh, DICK'S Sporting Goods is a leading omni-channel sporting goods retailer offering an extensive assortment of authentic, high-quality sports equipment, apparel, footwear and accessories.
