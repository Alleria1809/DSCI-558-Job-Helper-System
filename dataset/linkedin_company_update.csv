Our niches include OpenSource and Web Engineering; Data Science; and DevOps, SysOps and Infrastructure. Our philosophy is: Find something you're good at, and do it better than anyone else.

Die-hard Southerners view Atlanta as the heart of the Old Confederacy; Atlanta has become the best example of the New South, a fast-paced modern city proud of its heritage.

Serco,"Hook, Hampshire",http://www.serco.com/,"10,001+ employees",IT Services and IT Consulting,1988.0,"Serco is one of the world’s largest providers of public services to Governments, employing over 50,000 people in over 20 countries. The services we provide are often of critical importance to the communities and nations we serve.

Providing public services is one of the most satisfying and rewarding careers you can have. You have an ability to make a real positive difference to people’s lives and to the safety and security of your community and country. Serco operates in five sectors of public-service provision:  Health, Transport, Justice & Immigration, Defence and Citizens Services. Sometimes we are supporting people at troubled times in their lives, be they unemployed, refugees fleeing persecution, or in prison. In other parts of our business we are running some of the most advanced train services in the world, delivering essential support to armed forces, keeping hospitals safe and running 24x7, and providing environmental services.

Serco is a business where people and values matter. We have a strong public service ethos, and we employ people who want to make a positive difference to other people’s lives. We operate in North America, UK, Europe, Middle East, Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand, and we encourage people to develop their careers moving both between different businesses and countries.

And as a business which delivers “front-line” public services, employing tens of thousands of people, we are constantly developing and promoting people; our need for skilled leaders is insatiable, and few companies can offer as many opportunities for people to grow their careers.

We are looking for people to join Serco who share our desire to make a positive difference, the confidence to work as part of a team, the insight to spot the opportunity to do things better, and, importantly, the ability to take the initiative and put great ideas into practice wherever they are needed.",https://uk.linkedin.com/company/serco/about,https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E0BAQEaNY015L6CwA/company-logo_200_200/0/1663661096389?e=1677715200&v=beta&t=3QIpZz-xeq_l8hzPYLkwyYb6eCiZvFBD_kp3S3iTL_Y,Hampshire,Hook

The FNIH is not only involved in large, ambitious initiatives with potentially high impact on the lives of millions of the world’s citizens, but it also supports smaller focused programs in clinical training and ancillary support programs.

The FNIH helps to underwrite biomedical initiatives that might not be attractive for private funding alone, or for one reason or another are not appropriate for wholly public funding. The FNIH may take on projects that are particularly risky in terms of the likelihood of success or where companies may be willing to forgo profits because of early stage nature of the program or in the case of some global health initiatives due to the charitable nature of the project. 

The FNIH's projects tend to be longer-term, operating on a time scale that can be unattractive for private investors. At the same time the foundation is capable of responding quickly and nimbly to funding needs that are immediate and pressing.

With the goals of NIH as its guide, the FNIH serves both the public and private sectors, helping them achieve significant breakthroughs in human health in areas of interest that overlap with those of NIH.

Originally designed to deliver legal and advocacy services to the increasing number of people with mental illness leaving institutions and living in the community during the late 1970s, CHLP has expanded its innovative service model to include people from nearly all disability groups–those with developmental disabilities, visual impairments, physical disabilities, and people living with HIV/AIDS.

Today, the Community Health Law Project provides legal representation and advocacy services to low-income people with disabilities throughout the state. Its staff of 57 operates out of regional offices in Bloomfield, Elizabeth, Trenton, Eatontown, and Collingswood, an administration office in South Orange, and satellite offices in Atlantic, Hudson, Ocean, Salem, and Burlington counties. The organization is unique in that it specializes in services exclusively for people with disabilities, although its areas of expertise cover the entire range of civil law. Through negotiation, litigation and advocacy, the Community Health Law Project removes discriminatory barriers, protects rights and preserves independence and quality of life.

In its 37 years, the Community Health Law Project has provided services to more than 75,000 individuals. Each year, CHLP helps nearly 5,000 NJ residents with disabilities through brief service and representation. Nearly forty percent of CHLP’s cases are Social Security Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income matters, with 95% of the appeals resulting in reversals of denials.

"Morgan & Morgan, P.A.","Orlando, FL",http://www.ForThePeople.com,"1,001-5,000 employees",Legal Services,1988.0,"John Morgan became a lawyer with a simple mission: To fight for the people, and not the powerful. After experiencing firsthand the perils of choosing the wrong lawyer and representation after his brother Tim was paralyzed, he dedicated his life to helping people so that no one should ever have to go through what his family endured.

Tim was just a teenager when he was working as a lifeguard at Disney World when he suffered a spinal injury that left him confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life. The Morgans made a life altering decision and they hired the wrong lawyer, who was by no means qualified to take on such a large corporation and their army of lawyers. As a result, Tim never got the compensation he deserved. 

This experience left John outraged and determined to level the playing field for all people who, like his brother Tim, were injured or mistreated by big and powerful corporations. John decided to become a lawyer, and the rest is history. 

Since 1988, Morgan & Morgan has been fighting for the people. Every client who walks through our doors is treated the same way John wished his family would have been treated all those years ago. No one, no matter who they are, or where they’re from, should ever feel powerless when fighting for the justice and compensation they deserve.

Central Ohio Primary Care was founded in 1996 when a group of 33 physicians joined together to give greater focus to patient care than the administrative duties that were weighing them down. From the onset, COPC physicians have always been dedicated to finding new ways to offer the best patient care.

Today we have more than 70 practices and serve more than 400,000 patients. However, what’s most notable isn’t our size, but that we have grown beyond the primary care office. We have a hospitalist team with physicians at hospitals across the region, we’re opening more SameDay Centers, and are expanding our ancillary services.

We are leading the nation with a system that supports the entire care of each COPC patient.

A model we believe is THE BEST FOR PRIMARY CARE.

Phillip and Patricia Frost Museum of Science,"Miami, FL",http://www.frostscience.org,51-200 employees,"Museums, Historical Sites, and Zoos",1949.0,"In 1949, The Junior League of Miami's ""Project Finding Committee"" determined that Dade County's children needed a science museum. The Junior Museum of Miami, a private non-profit organization, was established in 1950 in a house on the corner of Biscayne Boulevard and 26th Street. The Junior Museum expanded so quickly that in 1952 it was forced to move to the Miami Women's Club building on Bayshore Drive. It was then christened the Museum of Science and Natural History.

The institution, however, again began outgrowing its new space. By 1960, the first building of the community's new science museum opened its doors. The facility, located on three acres of the historic Vizcaya complex, was built and furnished rent-free by the County.

Late 1966 saw the construction of a Space Transit Planetarium which soon became the leading facility of its kind in the world. Its activities now include international television programming.

In 1989, the Museum's lease agreement with the County for the Vizcaya site was extended for 99 years.

During the last decade, the Museum has expanded to provide space for 4,000 member families, over 250,000 annual visitors, one of the largest summer science camps in the nation (ages 3 to 14) and countless additional exhibits, collections and activities. The yearly operating budget has grown to 2.5 million dollars.

Present science education needs in South Florida again require expansion of these facilities. Though the history of the institution can be charted by the growth of its facility, this story is ultimately one of people. For almost 50 years, the Miami Science Museum and Space Transit Planetarium has been nurtured by a legion of tireless volunteers and generous contributors. Their abundance of vision and dedication has rarely been equaled by any other civic group in the city's history. Here, the greatness of the accomplishment can be found.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/miami-science-museum/about,https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQFx7I7AwpheEg/company-logo_200_200/0/1519864271755?e=1677715200&v=beta&t=VtBbi5NG0deEjuQOFlWZIrWqFDgW4eZPnXccVGYoV4g,FL,Miami

VISCO Global Trade Software,"Kingston, NY",http://www.viscosoftware.com,11-50 employees,Software Development,2001.0,"VISCO was designed specifically for importers and distributors, with an emphasis on chemical, plastics, food, and wine. Origins of the system and its founders date all the way back the 1980s, but VISCO's first customer went live in 2004. Since then we have evolved with the market to provide robust Warehouse Management, Inventory Management, Procurement, and more.

The software can thrive on its own as a CRM and Supply Chain solution giving your team all the tools an import and distribution business needs to operate efficiently. It can also integrate seamlessly with existing accounting systems like QuickBooks, Xero, the Sage/MAS Suite or most any Microsoft platform (Great Plains, etc.) to deliver a full and complete ERP solution for significantly less time, effort and money than a massive ERP implementation typically requires. VISCO was designed and developed with an emphasis on costing, lot tracking, importing compliance, as well as a fully-functional CRM module. With VISCO, all departments can communicate effectively, providing a platform for cohesive teamwork. The document management module pulls data directly from the database, and uses Microsoft Office integration to develop all necessary documents for import and export.

When issues arise during the distribution process, VISCO will assess the issue and email notifications to the correct team member, so that management can work quickly to find a solution. For example, if any POs have not shipped that were scheduled to do so, shipping managers are notified so that they can coordinate an updated ship date with the vendor. Several notifications come pre-built into the software, but customized alerts can be easily created. We can customize further using integration touch-points including our own API and custom report tools.

For distributors and importers seeking an end-to-end distribution, ERP, and procurement system to help streamline workflow and boost productivity, we recommend VISCO as an option to explore.

PlantTape Inc.,"Hollister, California",https://www.planttape.com/,11-50 employees,Farming,,"The PlantTape automated transplanting system increases crop yield, improves efficiency, and lowers per-acre cost for growers of hemp, tomatoes, and vegetables in the US and across the globe.

Sowing operations: once a customer's seed is received to a PlantTape sowing facility, it is inventoried and stored in a secure, climate-controlled room until sowing.

Seeds are sown into PlantTape material, after which the material is cut into strips (i.e, ""tape""), folded, and loaded into trays of 840 seeds each.

The sown PlantTape is palletized, wrapped and labeled for immediate delivery to a commercial nursery or farming operation  for germination at the desired time.

Because PlantTape sows seeds into a completely dry tape environment, growers can delay germination to account for unforeseen changes in weather or transplanting schedule.

Nursery operations: nurseries initiate germination via standard irrigation methods.

PlantTape trays hold 840 plants—2-3 times more than standard transplant trays. With a denser seedling population, PlantTape maximizes nursery space and improves efficiencies through the nursery and field transportation process.

PlantTape transplants can be planted at any stage of growth. Such flexibility in the planting schedule allows growers to mitigate the impact of adverse weather and other uncontrollable circumstances.

Because PlantTape seedlings can be planted much younger than conventional transplants, nurseries have shorter growing cycles and higher overall throughput.

Transplanting: from the nursery, trays of PlantTape transplants are loaded into bins and shipped to the field, where they are loaded into the PlantTape automated transplanter.
The transplanter pulls the PlantTape material from the trays and places each transplant into the ground according to precise settings line spacing, plant spacing, and depth.

PlantTape's 3-point planter can be adjusted in the field for almost any bed configuration.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/planttape-inc/about,https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQE0K2pd0bjlSg/company-logo_200_200/0/1654721267818?e=1677715200&v=beta&t=XtfOq_6goqXZJ9v0X19AJYT9xVI6uXApneaIY1WMLjY,CA,Hollister

AOI is a leading designer and manufacturer of fiber optic networking products. We primarily serve three growing end-markets: cable television broadband, fiber-to-the-home, and internet data centers. We are vertically integrated with a product portfolio from laser chips, components, sub-assemblies and modules, to complete turn-key equipment. 

All three of our end-markets are driven by bandwidth demand fueled by the growth of network connected devices, such as video traffic, cloud computing and online social networking. To address this increased demand, CATV and telecommunications service providers are investing to improve their networks in competition to deliver  voice, video, and data services to their subscribers. Rising bandwidth consumption is also driving demand for higher speed server connections in the internet data center market. As a result of these trends, fiber optic networking technology has become fundamental in all three of our target markets to meet these needs.

Our vertical integration, broad product lines, and in-house design capability uniquely position AOI to serve these markets and offer us the flexibility to address tomorrow's fiber optic applications.

We are committed to providing pure, powerful products for every family and lifestyle, all infused with the life-changing benefits of our essential oils.
Our community of wellness started small in 1993, when D. Gary Young and Mary Young developed their first organic herb farming and distillation operation. At the time, Gary Young had already discovered the incredible power of essential oils, but because the quality of available oils varied so greatly, he’d been unable to fully harness their potential. Mary’s previous experience in the direct-selling industry enabled the Young's to fulfill their vision and establish a business that would empower its members to share truly pure essential oils with the world.

After establishing Young Living in 1994, the Young's developed more farmland in Utah and Idaho and began cultivating lavender, peppermint, melissa, clary sage, and many other herbs. Fueled by a growing demand for top-quality essential oils, Young Living designed and built the largest, most technologically advanced essential oil distillery in North America. In harmony with these efforts, Young Living developed its groundbreaking Seed to Seal® process, which preserves the integrity and potency of essential oils through every step of the production process.

Headquartered in Lehi, Utah, with offices in Australia, Europe, Canada, Japan, and Singapore, as well as farms around the world, Young Living stays true to the Young's original vision.

And in 1958 he opened the first store in San Francisco’s famed Fisherman’s Wharf and called it Cost Plus World Market. The store quickly became a destination for those who craved original and handmade items from around the world. Items were sold at cost, plus ten percent - hence the name Cost Plus World Market!

The company has over 240 of its own patient care centres worldwide, ensuring close relationships with users and providing key momentum for the improvement of existing solutions and the development of new ones. As we move forward with the digitalisation of the fitting process, we are boosting efficiency and making our treatment more comfortable – for external orthopaedics companies and medical supply companies as well.
We have maintained a stable growth track for many years, and our sales topped the one billion mark for the first time in 2019. Our over 8,000 employees worldwide contribute to achieving this.

We design and supply medical solutions to enhance performance in healthcare – from the hospital to the home. 

Around the world, healthcare systems and professionals are under pressure to deliver better care, to more people, for better value. They need innovative solutions they can trust. That’s where we come in. We’re here to advance performance in healthcare. So we’re always on the lookout for new ways to improve. Our focus: providing effective solutions and offering better value for money.

Solutions to improve outcomes

We have one purpose – to advance performance in healthcare across the world. So that healthcare professionals have what they need to achieve the best clinical, patient and financial outcomes.

But different healthcare professionals have different needs. So we start by listening and making sure we understand them. Then we create solutions that are right for them and for their patients, and that are supported by evidence.

We contribute to advancing performance in other ways too. By sharing knowledge about our specialist clinical areas. And by helping to shape healthcare policies and protocols to raise standards of care worldwide.

We have a strong commitment to healthcare professionals. And we’re proving it every day.

A global company with a Swedish heritage

Customers use our solutions in almost 100 countries – and we own operations in more than 40 of them.

Discount Tire,"Scottsdale, AZ",http://www.discounttire.com,"10,001+ employees",Motor Vehicle Manufacturing,1960.0,"With more than 1,000 stores in the U.S., Discount Tire has grown to become the world's largest independent tire and wheel retailer today. The company was founded in 1960 when founder Bruce T. Halle rented a building on Stadium Boulevard in Ann Arbor, MI. Although the inventory consisted of only six tires (four of which were retreads) and the showroom was not quite the showroom we see today, faith, vision and hard work were then, and still remain, the foundation on which this company has grown and prospered.

As with any new start up, Bruce Halle's venture faced numerous challenges - perhaps one of the biggest being that he didn't own an air compressor. Having only six tires and a portable air tank, Halle would race back and forth to a nearby gas station, filling the tires with air as he sold them. Day by day, tire by tire, this one-man operation slowly grew into what is now one of the most recognized names in the industry.

Discount Tire has a vision that not only lives but thrives in the hearts of its employees each and every day. From part-time to full-time employees at the store, regional or corporate level our employees work to be the best in the business.

One common thread running through the hearts of everyone within the organization remains the same - treat customers and fellow employees with respect and fairness. Care for those in need, always do what is right, work hard, be responsible and have fun.

The employees of Discount Tire represent our philosophy and its brand by remaining knowledgeable, friendly and honest. By offering the highest level of customer service, more product choices and the lowest prices, they have earned the right to be considered trusted experts.

When we say we ""enrich the lives in the communities we serve,"" we take it to heart because we live it every day. At COUNTRY Financial, there are countless moments that prove it.  

It's the claims rep who leaves her family for weeks, then drives through the night to help clients rebuild after a hurricane.

It's the widower who can keep the house and put the kids through college because 10 years ago, his financial rep started the right conversation.

It's the agency assistant who spends weekends sewing masks for essential workers during a pandemic.

It's the ITS team, who in a moment's notice, helps an entire corporation transition to remote work so we can continue to keep the promise we made to our clients.

It's a company that, despite a turbulent market, triples the grant budget so our reps can provide even more support to first responders and healthcare workers when they need it most.

We believe our clients and communities are at the heart of everything we do. It's represented in how we act. It's how we serve. It's how we treat our clients and each other.

"Carlex Glass America, LLC","Nashville, TN",http://www.carlex.com,"1,001-5,000 employees",Motor Vehicle Manufacturing,1989.0,"At Carlex, we know serving a car owner ultimately means better serving car manufacturers and designers and those who service and repair cars. It also means providing the proper tools to our glassmakers, the people at the heart of our reputation for technology, quality and timely delivery. Our aim is to improve every interaction to make the experience of engineering, crafting, sourcing, installing or repairing quality automotive glass a positive one for all involved.  We’ve grown to meet this challenge, investing in technology, global resources and a network of the world’s most integrated glassmaking facilities and processes.

But the greatest investment is the one made by our people – generations of highly trained glassmakers who take pride in crafting everything we imagine, touch, test and deliver.

The origins of Carlex can be traced back to 1936 when Central Glass Co. Ltd., then known as Ube Soda Industry Co. Ltd., was established in Japan. In 1958, the company launched it's glass business, followed by the acquisition of a North American architectural glass facility in Seattle, WA in 1974, and then opening its first major automotive glass facility in Vonore, TN in 1991 in partnership with Ford Motor Company.

Carlex has continually focused on one thing: a commitment to excellence in providing the best automotive glass products to its global customers. This has been a springboard as Carlex grew from the single Vonore facility in 1995, to the 2011 purchase of Ford’s former Nashville, TN float glass, fabrication operations, and the aftermarket business which doubled its North American footprint. Carlex  doubled its size in 2014 by acquiring three manufacturing sites in Auburn and Ligonier, IN and Grevenmacher, Luxembourg.

The company is a member in just about every professional elevator organization or association, and is dedicated to making elevators safer for industry professionals and passengers. 

History

Founded as G.A.L Electro Mechanical Services in 1927 by Herbert Glaser, Jack Ambramowitz, and Harold Leon, the company started out with its own line of gate switches, interlocks, and door operators. The company quickly grew from being a key local supplier of lift products into a major national provider to the industry. In 1960 the company purchased Hollister-Whitney and soon after was renamed GAL Manufacturing Corp. The company moved to its current location in 1970. GAL's 100,000 sq. ft. manufacturing facility is located in the Bronx, near Yankee Stadium, at 50 East 153rd St.

In 2005 GAL acquired Elevator Components Inc. (ECI), merging them with GAL Canada. In 2018, GAL acquired Courion, a leading provider of freight elevator door systems, Bore-Max, a producer of highly regarded hydraulic elevator components, and Elevator Controls, a highly renowned designer/manufacturer of elevator control systems. In 2018 all the companies united under the name of ""Vantage"" to create a stronger, centralized partner that would provide customers with easy access to an unprecedented range of resources.

The Company was founded by a very experienced team of Staffing Industry professionals whose roots in the Temp staffing industry extend all the way back to the 1950’s and 60’s.

After individually creating, building, and managing their respective Staffing organizations, the two founders ultimately sold their organizations in the late 90’s and retired to what they thought would be the “Good Life”. Having spent many years serving together as Directors of a national industry Trade Organization they stayed in touch, and when retirement lost its luster, they decided to meld their skills and actively go back into the industry they both knew and loved. From that decision flowed Visium Resources Inc. A new organization that would take advantage of the industries newest technologies for the sake of efficiency, but had at its core, the principle of doing business on a very personal level, Personal, meaning People to People. With that guiding Core Principle, Visium has imbued its staff with the concept that our way of doing business is to be based on the premise that in every business transaction, we are always serving two customers. Customer one is our Client Company, of course, but customer two shall always be our valued Contract Employees. Both Customers are considered a virtual extension of the Visium “Family”.

We safeguard the economy and well-being of 30 million Californians by ""keeping the lights on"" 24/7. 

As the impartial grid operator, the California ISO opens access to the wholesale power market that is designed to diversify resources and lower prices. It also grants equal access to 25,865 circuit-miles of power lines and reduces barriers to diverse resources competing to bring power to customers. 

The California ISO's function is often compared to that of air traffic controllers. It would be grossly unfair for air traffic controllers to represent one airline and profit from allowing that company's planes to go through before others.

How do we collect this data?
Over nearly a decade, we’ve created processes and relationships with agencies where we collect purchasing records in the form of POs directly from agencies.

Our mission is to help procurement professionals make better purchasing decisions and find potential leads.
