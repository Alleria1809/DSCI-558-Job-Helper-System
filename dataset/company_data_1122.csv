Each week, approximately 220 million customers and members visit approximately 10,500 stores and clubs under 48 banners in 24 countries and eCommerce websites. With fiscal year 2021 revenue of $559 billion, Walmart employs over 2.3 million associates worldwide. Walmart continues to be a leader in sustainability, corporate philanthropy and employment opportunity. It’s all part of our unwavering commitment to creating opportunities and bringing value to customers and communities around the world.

Working at Walmart

Our people make the difference. That phrase started as a meeting theme in 1979 and has since been our way of thinking. We couldn’t serve our customers without the continued support of our greatest asset: our associates. We’re proud to support them by offering jobs at all levels – and investing in our workforce through training and skills development so that all jobs lead to careers.

At Walmart, we remind ourselves each day that our work isn’t just about what we achieve but how we achieve it. The way we conduct our business is as important as the products we sell and the services we provide. That means complying with the laws of the communities where we do business. But that is not enough. Associates who work at Walmart are expected to operate based on our high standards and values—respect, service, excellence, and integrity.

Acting consistently with these values demands that a culture of integrity guides all our decisions. Our Code of Conduct reflects who we are as a company and how we bring our culture to life in our work every day. It applies to every Walmart associate. We also expect our business partners to embrace our values and meet these high standards. Associates and partners who do not share these values do not belong at Walmart.

Our commitment to integrity is reflected in our actions. From ensuring the food and products we sell are safe; to using technology and data ethically and responsibly; to investigating concerns raised by our customers, associates, and stakeholders. Our commitments are embedded into every action we take.

Integrity builds trust. That’s why our associates, customers, investors, suppliers, and business partners choose Walmart—they know we are a business they can trust.",$10+ billion (USD),http://careers.walmart.com/,

1. Focus on Clients
2. Focus on Consultants
3. Focus on Technology

In any good business, the customer comes first – and NOVUS is no exception. Our client list includes both Fortune 500 companies as well as aspiring startups – and both tiers command our full attention to their needs. We treat each client with the respect they deserve, with the understanding that there is no shortage of contracting firms out there vying for their attention. The greatest compliment our consultants are paid is when a client says they thought our people were ‘their people,’ due to the dedication to the client’s needs.

Our consultants are selected from the top talent available in the marketplace, and they face a rigorous screening process before we put them in front of a client. Not just anyone can make it, but for those who do, they are rewarded with market-beating compensation, generous benefits, and incentives to help both our clients and NOVUS. We believe that a professional who is not respected and well taken care of cannot give their best performance to our clients.

Finally, NOVUS is a technology company. From software development and integration to technical project management, NOVUS consultants provide our clients with the technical expertise they need to thrive in our ever more connected world. Telecom underlies so much of what we take for granted today – from the lowly landline telephone that started it all to the always-on Internet connectivity of our various devices.

Memorial Hermann Health System,"https://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-Memorial-Hermann-Health-System-EI_IE4459.11,41.htm","Houston, TX",10000+ Employees,1906,Company - Private,Health Care Services & Hospitals,"At Memorial Hermann Health System, our 29,000 employees and 6,200 affiliated physicians share a vision to create healthier communities, now and for generations to come. As part of our commitment to realizing this vision, we have advanced our efforts around equity, diversity and inclusion; expanded our work in the community and refocused on reducing our system’s impact on the environment. What follows is a brief summary of our current efforts in those areas.

Equity, Diversity and Inclusion in the Workplace and Beyond
At Memorial Hermann, we’re committed to building a culture of inclusion. Through our Equity, Diversity & Inclusion (EDI) initiatives, we have taken a “total system” approach, requiring the pulling of both behavioral and structural levers. In March 2022, Memorial Hermann appointed Dr. Toi Harris as Chief Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Officer to build on Memorial Hermann’s existing EDI initiatives by identifying and championing future opportunities to ensure that EDI will be the driving force behind every decision made and every action taken at Memorial Hermann. In addition, Memorial Hermann has established an EDI Executive Council that is sponsored by Memorial Hermann President and Chief Executive Officer David Callender, MD, and chaired by Memorial Hermann Chief Administrative and Legal Officer Deborah Gordon. The EDI Executive Council provides advocacy and oversight for Memorial Hermann’s EDI initiatives and programs while establishing the EDI roadmap for the entire system.

Improving the Health of the Community
To advance our vision of creating healthier communities, we first must recognize that the health of our community cannot change by focusing on health care alone. There are social and economic factors that can pose barriers to health. That’s why we are expanding our focus beyond hospital and clinic walls to address the social determinants of health by aligning our efforts around four key pillars:

- Access to Care
- Emotional Well-being
- Food as Health
- Exercise is Medicine

Memorial Hermann Community Benefit Corporation
Every three years, Memorial Hermann Community Benefit Corporation conducts a Community Health Needs Assessment to collect data and analysis for Harris, Fort Bend, Montgomery and Brazoria counties, which comprise the majority of Memorial Hermann discharges. Based on these studies, Memorial Hermann works with other healthcare providers, government agencies, business leaders and community stakeholders to ensure area residents have access to the services they need to improve their quality of life and the overall health of the community. Through Memorial Hermann Community Benefit Corporation, we are employing a collective set of strategies to develop efforts targeted at improving the health of the underinsured and uninsured in our community, such as:

- Community Resource Centers
- Neighborhood Health Centers
- Inpatient and ER Navigation
- School-based Health Centers
- 24-hour Nurse Triage Line
- Pharmacy Services and Education
- Psychiatric Social Worker
- Direct Primary Care Partnership
- Intensive Outpatient Case Management for Complex Patients
- Free Primary Care for Eligible Patients
- Multi-visit Patient Efforts & Education Strategies

Anchoring Investment in the Community
Hospitals have a long tradition of serving as Anchor Institutions within their communities, providing not only health care, but contracting with local businesses to purchase goods and services for building facilities and strengthening local businesses. Memorial Hermann proudly serves as a member of the Healthcare Anchor Network. As an Anchor Institute, we are working to leverage and align our resources to create meaningful change in Houston neighborhoods. We recognize that our investments don’t always have to be of a clinical nature to improve the health of the neighborhoods we serve.

Protecting and Improving the Environment
We only have one planet. The health and well-being of life on earth is intertwined with societal and ecological systems on which we all depend. To help ensure that people can live healthier lives, all organizations must reexamine how they operate on a day-to-day basis. In the healthcare industry, we not only must take care of our patients and the health of our community, but we must take care of the environment as well.

Building and Operating Sustainable Facilities
Sustainability is a guiding principle for our teams involved in the planning, design, construction and operations of our facilities. From cooling and lighting systems designed to reduce energy use to optimizing for natural building materials whenever possible to standardizing facilities for maximum efficiency in operation and maintenance, we strive to utilize the latest technical and industry expertise to further our goals in building and operating environmentally friendly facilities.

DICK’S Sporting Goods was founded in 1948 when an 18-year-old Dick Stack was working at an Army surplus store in Binghamton, New York. An avid fisherman, Dick was approached by the store owner to come up with a list of products needed to get into the fishing tackle business. After Dick presented his suggestions, the owner told him he was a dumb kid and had no idea what he was doing. Dick was upset and promptly quit. He went to his grandmother’s house where he spent a lot of time as a kid and told her what had happened. Dick’s grandmother asked how much it would cost to build the store himself. Dick said it would cost $300. His grandmother then went to the cookie jar where she kept her life savings and gave him $300 and told him, “Do it yourself.” Dick used that money and his relentless work-ethic to open a bait-and-tackle shop in Binghamton. By the late 1970's, he expanded his product line to include much of what you’ll find at DICK’S Sporting Goods today.

AND LIVES ON...
Today, headquartered in Pittsburgh, DICK'S Sporting Goods is a leading omni-channel sporting goods retailer offering an extensive assortment of authentic, high-quality sports equipment, apparel, footwear and accessories. The company serves and inspires athletes and outdoor enthusiasts to achieve their personal best through a combination of its dedicated teammates, in-store services and unique specialty shop-in-shops dedicated to Team Sports, Athletic Apparel, Golf, Outdoor, Fitness and Footwear. DICK'S Sporting Goods also owns and operates Golf Galaxy and Field & Stream specialty stores, as well as GameChanger, a youth sports mobile app for scheduling, communications, live scorekeeping and video streaming.
