Crossplane was the first open source project to recognize Kubernetes for its control plane, and not as a container orchestrator, and has been leading the effort to democratize control plane technology in the cloud-native community. Our mission is to enable a new era of infrastructure management that is automated, efficient, reliable and empowers application teams to self-service any resource they need and deliver software faster.

We are building solutions that accelerate development velocity and innovation at global enterprises, with a control plane-centric approach. Upbound Universal Crossplane (UXP) enables platform teams to create their own opinionated platform declaratively without having to write any code and offer it to their developers as a self-service Kubernetes-style API. 

Upbound’s product offerings are available via a subscription model that currently has two tiers. The first is a free tier catering to individuals getting started with control planes and who need tooling to debug and share their Crossplane providers and configurations. It includes full access to Universal Crossplane (UXP), the ability to publish public listings in Upbound Registry, and limited access to Upbound Cloud. Upbound’s enterprise tier unlocks additional value across the product portfolio. Platform teams can manage unlimited control planes in Upbound Cloud, create unlimited private listings in Upbound Registry, and get access to 24/7 support, prioritized bug fixes, implementation services, onboarding and training.

Any organization looking to simplify and accelerate cloud native operations and empower their developers, should try Upbound.

Upbound was founded in 2017 and is a remote-first company. The company is backed by GV (formerly Google Ventures) and Telstra Ventures. ",https://www.linkedin.com/company/upbound-io?trk=public_jobs_topcard-org-name

As a young girl, she discovered her love for jewelry in the shops and stalls of Ponte Vecchio. An artist first and a designer second, Ippolita studied sculpture and ceramics for five years at the Istituto D’Arte in Florence. After working in bronze and stone on large-scale works, Ippolita was inspired to apply her aesthetic to the world of adornment when she launched her eponymous jewelry collection in 1999 in New York with Bergdorf Goodman. 

A reverence for women and the female body has informed her style and her design vocabulary from the start. Her highly personal approach to fine jewelry is expressed in the sculptural nature of the organic shapes of her precious metals. A proprietary blend of 18K Gold and other precious metals creates a distinctive “green” hue, flattering to all skin types while her 925 Silver is a color with a brilliance all its own. The stone cuts Ippolita uses are characterized by their artfully random, larger-than-normal facets that conspire to create plays of light and shadow against the skin. 

Ippolita’s jewelry is an encounter with beauty. That beauty is an experience shared – between seller and buyer, wearer and creator, lover and loved one, devotee and neophyte. It is generous, participatory, outward-facing, welcoming, and open to all.

Ward Diesel & Ward Clean Air Products History:

Ward Diesel Filter Systems was established in 1987.  Henry Kaeser patented the “NO SMOKE” exhaust removal system in 1989.  The apparatus-mounted system provided a “source capture” alternative to the old way of addressing the problem with hanging hoses.  Over the last 20 years, Ward Diesel Filter Systems has installed literally thousands of “NO SMOKE” systems on fire apparatus throughout the United States and across the world.  Ward Diesel Filter Systems has developed a strong reputation for a quality product, a superior method of source capture, and an excellent track record of service after the sale.  Due to the increased concern of diesel emission inhalation and the desire to get “up-to-date” with the various standards, Ward Diesel can point to a great number of satisfied customers.

In 2007, Ward Diesel began offering verified emission control devices into markets other than the fire industry as Ward Clean Air Products.  Since this time we have installed Diesel Particulate Filters (DPF), Diesel Oxidation Catalysts (DOC) and Closed Crank Case Ventilation Systems (CCV) on both over the road and off-road vehicles.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/best-ward-diesel?trk=public_jobs_topcard-org-name

We serve St. Lawrence, Franklin and Jefferson counties, with sites located in Canton, Gouverneur, Malone, Ogdensburg, and Watertown.   

We pride ourselves in acting as a safety net for those without health insurance or for those who are under-insured. To accommodate those who are uninsured or under insured, we offer a sliding fee scale for most of our services based on the patient's family size and income.

Our health center is always evolving to ensure patients are getting  the highest quality and most comprehensive healthcare possible. In 2007, our St. Lawrence and Franklin County sites were designated as Federally Qualified Health Centers, which  means our health center meets rigorous governance, quality of care and cost standards. In 2011, we transitioned from all paper files to a new electronic medical record system. This transition has not only made the tracking of each of our patients' health care more efficient, but it also allows clinicians to access medical records more quickly in cases of emergency.  

CHCNC continues to find ways to improve quality, access, cost, and implementation of its primary and preventive care services.  In 2016 our health centers in Canton, Gouverneur, and Malone gained PCMH Level III accreditation.

That was over 3 decades ago and whilst Charles Tyrwhitt (it rhymes with spirit by the way) is still famous for proper shirts, these days we are about so much more than collars and cuffs. Our purpose is to “make it easy for men to dress well”. We take care of a chap’s entire wardrobe, providing stylish solutions for every occasion. We make sure he gets what he wants, when and how he wants it.

Our spiritual home and flagship store is located on London’s famous Jermyn Street. Our Global Head Office is in London Bridge, whilst we also have an office in Manhattan to support our retail and online presence across North America, Europe and Australia. Not forgetting our Distribution Centre and Contact Centre in Milton Keynes.

At Charles Tyrwhitt we believe in doing the right thing. That means making our products properly and sustainably, making our business work for our people, our customers, and our suppliers and giving back to charity to support those in need. We’re taking a good hard look at our social and environmental impact, and always looking for ways to be better.

Green Corps' one-year, full-time, paid Field School for Environmental Organizing includes intensive classroom training, hands-on field experience running urgent environmental and public health campaigns, and career placement in positions with leading environmental groups.

If you want to gain the skills to run a campaign to stop global warming, defend old growth forests from corporate logging companies, or start your own environmental group, apply to Green Corps' 2019-2020 Field School for Environmental Organizing.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/green-corps?trk=public_jobs_topcard-org-name

Griswold Home Care was first conceived in response to a tragedy that befell a member of the church where the Rev. Dr. Lincoln Griswold (our founder's husband) was the pastor. An aging, widowed parishioner could not find anyone to help her after her primary caregiver fell and broke her hip. Although her family lived nearby, the woman was left alone and did not drink enough fluids. As a result, she passed away from kidney failure.

Inspired by this apparent growing need in her community, Jean Griswold started Griswold Home Care at her Erdenheim, Pa home in 1982. As the company’s reputation for affordable services grew, requests for care started to come from beyond the local community. Additional home care centers were opened to meet the growing needs of each community; creating work opportunities for local professional caregivers who knew the area and who could better service neighboring clients, even in bad weather conditions.

What began as a grassroots organization of competent, compassionate individuals has since grown into the world’s oldest non-medical home care organization. In the three decades since the company's inception, Griswold Home Care has helped more than 80,000 individuals, referring more than 9,000 caregivers in any given year.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/griswold-home-care?trk=public_jobs_topcard-org-name

At the intersection of craft and beverage, the story of Pura Vida Tequila dates back to 1923, when two brothers worked the agave fields outside Arandas in the heart of Mexico’s finest agave-producing region. Under the care of these vigilant agaveros, the fields of beautiful blue agave in Los Altos earned international acclaim for their exceptional quality, rich flavor, and high sugar content (the lifeblood of tequila). Here, among fourth-generation agaveros, the first expression of Pura Vida Tequila was brewing.

Delivering an authentic farm-to-bottle experience, Luckenbach Road Whiskey Distillery’s roots date back to 1851. That’s the year when our founder’s third great-grandfather, Heinrich “Henry” Ochs, moved his family from Germany to Gillespie County. He quickly became one of the town’s first teachers, as well as a County Clerk – and opened the Buckhorn Saloon, serving the family recipe for whiskey and beer. Now, 170 years later, the same premium whiskey recipe will become the centerpiece of a new, 28,000-square-foot facility, world class tasting room and charming country store called Little Peach. The site is located at 21 Luckenbach Road, in the heart of the Texas Hill Country. Great attention to detail and sustainability helps each bottle capture the unique richness, depth and complexity of local flavors while the family’s recipe ensures a historic, smooth finish.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/frontier-spirits-company?trk=public_jobs_topcard-org-name

Lack of a stable home exacerbates chronic medical and mental health conditions, making it very difficult to improve one’s life.

Living in Seattle, she fell in love with Pike Place Market with its inspiring blend of products, artisans, and farmers. To her, it was a special gathering place for food lovers and culinary visionaries alike. 

When Shirley opened her first store in Pike Place Market, she was determined to assemble the best selection of cookware, gadgets, linens and books—even importing exclusive specialty items from France,  her favorite culinary destination. Using the market as her inspiration, she thoughtfully filled her store with cooking tools that would bring people together in the kitchen and around the table. This sense of connection and love of French cuisine inspired the name Sur La Table, which simply means “on the table.”

Since then we’ve grown to 56 stores across America, with the largest avocational cooking program in the U.S. But some things haven’t changed: We’re still the place for an unsurpassed selection of exclusive and premium-quality goods for the kitchen and table.

After your consultation, you will know exactly what it will cost to complete your dental implant treatment.

Traditionally, dental implants require several visits to specialists in several locations, and the teeth are created at an off-site lab and shipped to the office. If any adjustments needed to be made, the teeth would need to be shipped back to the lab. At ClearChoice, we have combined all of the necessary elements for successful dental implant treatment in a single location.
