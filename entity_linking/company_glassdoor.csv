Headquartered in SeaTac, Washington USA. Basta Boatlifts is a company dedicated to life on the water.

The Innovation Leader
Basta began as a small and local dock company in the 1980’s, selling boat lifts, building docks, and repairing bulkheads. Experience with all kinds of waterfront setups lead to the realization that we could do it better. Basta embarked on a new way to secure and protect boats.

Innovations emerged quickly, and in 1989 Basta Boatlifts entered the Seattle Boat Show with the first-ever solar powered remote-control accessory. The first Basta boat lift followed in 1990 – a cable PWC lift, very similar to our 1.4k lift today.

Shortly thereafter Basta Boatlifts invented the industry changing “Over-Center” gravity locking design making the cantilever style boat lift safer than ever. While other boat lift manufacturers designed boat lifts that fought gravity, Basta used gravity to keep a boat in place. The Over-Center gravity locking design was patented in 1993 and now is the standard throughout the boat lift industry.

The company’s passion for continuous improvement continues and today, Basta Boatlifts holds over 12 patents, with more pending, to bring you the best for your boat.",Unknown / Non-Applicable,http://www.bastaboatlifts.com/

We couldn’t serve our customers without the continued support of our greatest asset: our associates. We’re proud to support them by offering jobs at all levels – and investing in our workforce through training and skills development so that all jobs lead to careers.

At Walmart, we remind ourselves each day that our work isn’t just about what we achieve but how we achieve it. The way we conduct our business is as important as the products we sell and the services we provide. That means complying with the laws of the communities where we do business. But that is not enough. Associates who work at Walmart are expected to operate based on our high standards and values—respect, service, excellence, and integrity.

Acting consistently with these values demands that a culture of integrity guides all our decisions. Our Code of Conduct reflects who we are as a company and how we bring our culture to life in our work every day. It applies to every Walmart associate. We also expect our business partners to embrace our values and meet these high standards. Associates and partners who do not share these values do not belong at Walmart.

Our commitment to integrity is reflected in our actions. From ensuring the food and products we sell are safe; to using technology and data ethically and responsibly; to investigating concerns raised by our customers, associates, and stakeholders. Our commitments are embedded into every action we take.

Integrity builds trust. That’s why our associates, customers, investors, suppliers, and business partners choose Walmart—they know we are a business they can trust.",$10+ billion (USD),http://careers.walmart.com/

His concept was so successful, Reed joined forces with seven other firms to create American Air Filter Co. in 1929.

The Special Olympics mission remains as vital today as it did when the movement was founded in 1968. Special Olympics strives to create a better world by fostering the acceptance and inclusion of all people.

Through the power of sports, people with intellectual disabilities discover new strengths and abilities, skills and success. Our athletes find joy, confidence and fulfillment -- on the playing field and in life. They also inspire people in their communities and elsewhere to open their hearts to a wider world of human talents and potential.

There are as many as 200 million people with intellectual disabilities around the world. Our goal is to reach out to every one of them – and their families as well. Special Olympics does this through a wide range of trainings, competitions, health screenings and fund-raising events. We also create opportunities for families, community members, local leaders, businesses, law enforcement, celebrities, dignitaries and others to band together to change attitudes and support athletes.

The transformative power of sports to instill confidence, improve health and inspire a sense of competition is at the core of what Special Olympics does. From the detailed coaching guides we provide in many languages to the sharp-eyed officials at our international games, the focus is on real sports, real competition, real achievements.

In Special Olympics, the power and joy of sport, shifts focus to what our athletes CAN do, not what they can't. Attention to disabilities fades away. Instead, we see our athletes' talents and abilities -- and applaud them for all that they can do. And they are doing a lot -- from gymnastics to soccer to open-water swimming. With our 30-plus Olympic-style sports, we offer adults and children with intellectual disabilities many ways to be involved in their communities, many ways to show who they really are.",$100 to $500 million (USD),http://www.specialolympics.org/

But that is not enough. Associates who work at Walmart are expected to operate based on our high standards and values—respect, service, excellence, and integrity.

Acting consistently with these values demands that a culture of integrity guides all our decisions. Our Code of Conduct reflects who we are as a company and how we bring our culture to life in our work every day. It applies to every Walmart associate. We also expect our business partners to embrace our values and meet these high standards. Associates and partners who do not share these values do not belong at Walmart.

In 1910 he traded his luxurious hotel for 240 prime acres of pear orchards in Southern Oregon’s Rogue River Valley and named his orchard after Bear Creek, which flowed through the fertile valley. In 1914, after also graduating from Cornell with agricultural degrees, Harry and David inherited the orchards and established the company we know today.

The brothers chose to specialize in Comice pears, the intensely sweet and juicy pears originally from the south of France and highly coveted in upscale European markets. Though they required very specific growing conditions and were hard to produce in abundance, the Rogue Valley proved ideal, and the special variety that the brothers cultivated was even more delicious, and hardier, than its French counterpart. To set their remarkable pears apart from all others, Harry and David branded their luxurious pears “Royal Riviera.”

By 1934, with Royal Rivera® Pears gaining worldwide popularity, Harry & David began creating gourmet gifts featuring their pears. Building on their initial success, they came up with gift baskets, Fruit-of-the-Month Club® Collections, and enticing gift towers, including the Signature Holiday Tower of Treatssup® Gift, still our most popular gift. The brothers paid scrupulous attention to every detail, and quality was their number one goal.

To this day, we still hand pick all of our fruit at peak ripeness, craft our own baked goods and confections, pack our gifts by hand, and ship everything to arrive in perfect condition, ready to share and enjoy.

Wolferman’s and Stock Yards
Two other venerable brands complete the Harry & David portfolio. Wolferman’s has been synonymous with fine baking since 1888, and is most known for their incredible English muffins. We’ve expanded their offerings to include breads, pastries, cakes, and other delicious treats along with breakfast and brunch items, pantry essentials, and even complete meals.

DICK’S Sporting Goods was founded in 1948 when an 18-year-old Dick Stack was working at an Army surplus store in Binghamton, New York. An avid fisherman, Dick was approached by the store owner to come up with a list of products needed to get into the fishing tackle business. After Dick presented his suggestions, the owner told him he was a dumb kid and had no idea what he was doing. Dick was upset and promptly quit. He went to his grandmother’s house where he spent a lot of time as a kid and told her what had happened. Dick’s grandmother asked how much it would cost to build the store himself. Dick said it would cost $300. His grandmother then went to the cookie jar where she kept her life savings and gave him $300 and told him, “Do it yourself.” Dick used that money and his relentless work-ethic to open a bait-and-tackle shop in Binghamton. By the late 1970's, he expanded his product line to include much of what you’ll find at DICK’S Sporting Goods today.

AND LIVES ON...
Today, headquartered in Pittsburgh, DICK'S Sporting Goods is a leading omni-channel sporting goods retailer offering an extensive assortment of authentic, high-quality sports equipment, apparel, footwear and accessories. The company serves and inspires athletes and outdoor enthusiasts to achieve their personal best through a combination of its dedicated teammates, in-store services and unique specialty shop-in-shops dedicated to Team Sports, Athletic Apparel, Golf, Outdoor, Fitness and Footwear. DICK'S Sporting Goods also owns and operates Golf Galaxy and Field & Stream specialty stores, as well as GameChanger, a youth sports mobile app for scheduling, communications, live scorekeeping and video streaming.
